# Info
Color Swap is a web-based game for desktops built using Tauri. The goal is to move the player around the world to collect Bubbles which will allow you to gain points and money. Using the money you have collected will allow you to purchase upgrades to develop your player's skills. Around the map there are also PowerUps which will give skills a boost in their effectiveness over a short period of time.
